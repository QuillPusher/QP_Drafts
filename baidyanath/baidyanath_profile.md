### Major Contributions

#### C++/Python on-demand interoperability (InterOp, cppyy, CPyCppyy, cppyy-backend):

This project required deep understanding of the two major programming languages used in statistical analysis. It helped bridge the gap between Python's usability and C++'s performance. Baidyanath also enjoyed working with complex codebases, since the general programming wisdom directs most programmers towards code simplicfication, whereas with projects like these, code complexity is an inherent requriement.

#### interoperability between Cppyy and Numba

Using the principles established during Python/C++ interoperability developement, this was the next step in adding a third programming language to the mix. This meant more rules and restrictions since all three languages needed to agree on the specific operations.

#### Applications of Error Estimation Framework

Baidyanath's work in Error Estimation Framework development was mainly focused on High Energy Physics (HEP) applications, but it also demonstrated its possible applications in other High Performance Computing (HPC) fields as well.

#### Clad Array and Hessian support

This was Baidyanath's first exposure to compiler research. He found the restrictive nature of designing new software features both, challenging and rewarding. Specifically, template metaprogramming was a great are of interest for him.


### How leading companies can utilize this technology

During his IPDPS exposure, Baidyanath was please to interact with researchers who can use it for Climate Modeling. This is important because such models require a high level of accuracy. Another major use case is for Mixed Precision Analysis when using MLIR [^1].

### Why new programmers would want to learn about these features

Interoperability is not only targeted towards scientific analysis, but also new programmers that need an interactive way of learning complex programming concepts. Languages like Python have a lower barrier to entry, and interoperability with more complex languages like C++ enables students to explore these languages in a simplified and fast-paced manner.

### Soft skills and community outreach

An important skill that Baidyanath was able to attain during these projects was the ability to convey his work to other techincal people, who aren't necessarily from the same field. Participating in several conferences and presenting in front of large technical audiences helped him develop the tools to help motivate people to experiment with a new project/research for their specific applications.


[^1]: MLIR is a unifying software framework for compiler development. MLIR can make optimal use of a variety of computing platforms such as GPUs, DPUs,TPUs, FPGAs, AI ASICS, and quantum computing systems (QPUs). MLIR is a sub-project of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure project.
