### Getting to know Jun Zhang
Jun is a 3rd year undergraduate student, majoring in Software Engineering. He 
started working with Compiler Research Organization in May 2022 as a Google 
Summer of Code student, working on the Clang/LLVM infrastructure, contributing 
approximately 70 patches. 

Besides making useful contributions to help the High Energy Physics (HEP) 
field, he was also able to land critical patches to the upstream LLVM 
repositories, that will reduce the technical debt and help Compiler Research 
Org adapt the upcoming LVVM versions more seamlessly.

Besides accomplishing the technical aspects of each project, a major personal 
achievement for Jun was pitching these ideas to the broader LLVM community and 
demonstrating to them that these ideas would add value to their overall 
codebase. Intellectual discourse with, and acceptance from, the veterans of  
Clang project provided Jun with valuable insights into the inner workings of 
open source collaboration.
